# CSS-475-Database: Restaurant 
This application focuses on assisting the restaurant industry in providing services, specifically
for chain family restaurants. For example, Red Robin is a national chain restaurant with many
customers and reservations each day, along with a diverse menu. In addition, there may be
many chain restaurants under the same brand name, so we must be able to distinguish
between varying receipts, tables, and staff, and retrieve different information to maintain high
quality business posture. The following document is an outline for the implementation of a SQL
database that allows these many restaurants to query information from a central repository.
